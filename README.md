# Intelligent Complaint Analysis for Financial Services

A **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** powered chatbot that transforms unstructured customer complaints into **actionable insights** for internal teams at **CrediTrust Financial**.

---

## 🎯 Business Objective

CrediTrust Financial operates a mobile-first digital finance platform serving East African markets. With hundreds of thousands of users across multiple countries, the company receives **thousands of customer complaints every month** across products such as Credit Cards, Personal Loans, Savings Accounts, and Money Transfers.

Currently, valuable customer feedback is locked inside long, unstructured narratives, making it difficult for Product, Support, and Compliance teams to identify trends quickly.

This project delivers an **internal AI intelligence platform** that enables stakeholders to ask **natural-language questions** and receive **evidence-backed answers** in seconds.

## 🎯 Strategic Goals

### 1️⃣ Accelerate Insight Generation
- Reduce complaint analysis time from **days to minutes**
- Enable rapid detection of emerging product issues
- Free Product Managers from manual complaint reviews

### 2️⃣ Democratize Data Access
- Enable **self-service analytics** for non-technical teams
- Reduce dependency on data analysts
- Improve decision-making speed across departments

### 3️⃣ Enable Proactive Operations
- Identify recurring issues before escalation
- Support compliance and risk monitoring
- Shift from reactive to **data-driven proactive action**

## 🏦 Financial Products Covered

| Product Category | Common Issues Analyzed |

## 🧠 How the RAG System Works

1. **User Question**  
   A user asks a question in plain English (e.g., *“Why are customers unhappy with credit cards?”*).

2. **Semantic Retrieval**  
   The question is embedded and compared against a **vector database (ChromaDB/FAISS)** containing complaint text embeddings.

3. **Context Assembly**  
   The most relevant complaint excerpts are retrieved and combined into a structured prompt.

4. **Answer Generation**  
   An open-source LLM generates a concise, grounded response **using only retrieved evidence**.

5. **Source Transparency**  
   Retrieved complaint excerpts are displayed alongside the answer to build trust.

## 📊 Task 1: EDA & Preprocessing 

**Key Findings:**
- Analyzed 50,000 complaint records (sample)
- 92.5% of complaints are about "Credit reporting"
- Only 1.1% about Credit Cards, 0.7% about Savings Accounts
- **Critical Issue**: 98.7% of complaints lack narrative text!
- Filtered dataset: 50 records with narratives for target products

- Performed fast EDA on a **50,000-record sample** from a large-scale complaints dataset (>5GB)
- Analyzed key fields:
  - Date received
  - Product
  - Issue
  - Consumer complaint narrative
  - Company
  - State
- Identified severe class imbalance and missing narratives (~98%)
- Filtered dataset to **target financial products**:
  - Credit cards
  - Personal loans
  - Savings accounts
  - Money transfers
- Removed empty complaint narratives
- Applied basic text cleaning
- Generated a clean, RAG-ready dataset

**Final Output**
- `data/processed/filtered_complaints.csv` (50 records)
- `data/processed/filtered_complaints_sample.csv`

**Key Insights**
- Complaint data is highly imbalanced by product
- Very few records contain usable narrative text
- Filtering and preprocessing are critical before embedding

## 📌 Task 2: Text Chunking & Embedding Preparation

### 🎯 Objective
Prepare customer complaint narratives for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
using the **pre-built embeddings dataset** provided by the challenge.

---

### 📥 Input Data
- `complaint_embeddings.parquet` (~2.2 GB, pre-built)
- `complaints.csv` (raw complaints)
- `filtered_complaints.csv` (output from Task 1)

---

### 🔪 Chunking Strategy
- **Chunk size:** 500 characters  
- **Chunk overlap:** 50 characters  
- **Method:** Recursive character splitting  
- **Embedding model:** `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (pre-built)
- **Vector database:** ChromaDB

This strategy balances semantic completeness with efficient vector search
across large-scale complaint data.

---

### 📊 Sampling Strategy
To enable fast experimentation, a **stratified sample of 10,000 chunks** was created
from the full embeddings dataset (~1.37M chunks), preserving proportional
representation across product categories:

- Credit card: ~40%
- Personal loan: ~30%
- Savings account: ~20%
- Money transfers: ~10%


### ✅ Task 2 Status
✔ Chunking strategy documented  
✔ Pre-built embeddings integrated  
✔ Vector store structure prepared 
 
# Next Steps
- **Task 3**: Build RAG pipeline using pre-built embeddings
- **Task 4**: Create Gradio chat interface
- **Final**: Deploy working system for CrediTrust stakeholders
